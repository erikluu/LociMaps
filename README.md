## The Project
LociMaps is an innovative project that introduces a "pirate" map for immersive navigation and reasoning across extensive knowledge bases. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques and insights from cognitive neuroscience and affective computing, this project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with and make sense of large volumes of information.

### Key Features:

Immersive Navigation: LociMaps offers a unique and immersive interface that allows users to explore and navigate through vast knowledge repositories.

Semantic Organization: Machine learning techniques, including embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and label generation, are applied using Large Language Models (LLMs). These techniques empower LociMaps to organize files and abstract topics in a way that makes semantic sense, streamlining information retrieval and comprehension.

Visualizations with Impact: Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and affective computing, LociMaps doesn't just present data; it tells a story. The project generates engaging and meaningful visualizations that help users grasp complex concepts and relationships associated with the knowledge they explore.

Efficient Knowledge Discovery: Whether you're a researcher, student, or knowledge enthusiast, LociMaps ensures that your quest for information is both efficient and enjoyable. It transforms the often overwhelming task of navigating and reasoning with large knowledge bases into an engaging and insightful experience.

Customizable Experience: LociMaps is designed to be highly adaptable to different domains and users' styles. Users will personalize their navigation experience, through their own work and documents making it a powerful tool for professionals across various industries.

## Notes
LociMaps stems from the [Method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci).
> The method of loci is a strategy for memory enhancement, which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information.
